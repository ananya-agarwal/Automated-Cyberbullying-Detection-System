# Automated_cyberbullying_detection

Created Discord bot and Machine Learning model which will analyse text in discord channels and flag them based on Cyberbullying using Python. Libraries used: spacy, NLTK, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy etc.

The final execution of the project will have the following outcomes:
• A ML model which will reliably detect any cyberbullying activity over textual 
conversations on social media platforms using NLP.
• A fully functional discord bot having administrative capabilities which uses the above ML 
model to detect Cyberbullying and take appropriate actions when it detects such activity
